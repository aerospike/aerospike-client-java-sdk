# Advanced type inference

> **AEL v2** — Quick overview: [cheat-sheet.md](cheat-sheet.md). See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md), [open-issues.md](open-issues.md). **Last reviewed:** 2026-05-20.

The AEL should derive types of bins, map keys, map values, list values, and variables
wherever possible. When the parser encounters a bin or variable for the first time
its type is UNKNOWN. As parsing progresses, context reveals the type. If a bin or
variable is later encountered with a conflicting type, the parser must raise an error.

### Concrete types

`BOOLEAN`, `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`, `GEO`, `HLL`, `MAP`, `LIST`, `BLOB`

These are the only types that are valid at the end of parsing. Every bin, variable,
and sub-expression must resolve to one of these before an `Exp` can be emitted.

### Intermediate type states

During parsing, three intermediate states exist. These represent partial knowledge
that must be fully resolved before the parse completes.

| State | Meaning | Example origin | Must resolve to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UNKNOWN` | No type information yet. Every bin and variable starts here. | `$.a` first encountered | Any concrete type |
| `SAME_TYPE` | Two or more items must share the same type, but we don't yet know what that type is. Created by comparison operators when both sides are `UNKNOWN`. | `$.a == $.b` (no other context yet) | Any concrete type (once one side resolves, the other inherits) |
| `NUMERIC` | Known to be either `INTEGER` or `FLOAT`, but not yet determined which. Created by arithmetic operators when both sides are `UNKNOWN`. | `$.a + $.b` (no literals yet) | `INTEGER` or `FLOAT` |

**None of these intermediate states are valid at the end of parsing.** If any bin,
variable, or expression still has an intermediate state after the full expression
has been parsed and all deferred validations re-applied, the parser must raise an
error listing the unresolved items with a suggestion to add explicit type annotations
(e.g., **`$.a:INT`** or **`@:INT`**).

Examples of resolution:
```
$.a + $.b                        a, b: NUMERIC (from +)
$.a + $.b > 10                   a, b: INTEGER (NUMERIC resolved by literal 10)

$.a == $.b                       a, b: SAME_TYPE (from ==)
$.a == $.b and $.b > 'hello'     a, b: STRING (SAME_TYPE resolved by literal 'hello')

$.a + $.b                        a, b: NUMERIC — ERROR if no further context resolves them
$.a == $.b                       a, b: SAME_TYPE — ERROR if no further context resolves them
```

### Default type fallback (disallowed)

**AEL v2** forbids assigning **silent default types** when inference fails. A pattern sometimes seen elsewhere is:

- Map value access (e.g., `$.m.name`): default to `STRING`
- Other cases (list elements, bins): default to `INTEGER`

(For example via `TypeUtils.getDefaultType()` / `BinPart` defaulting to `Exp.Type.INT`.)

**Disallowed:** silent defaults cause unpredictable runtime behaviour: if the guess matches the data, the expression works; if not, the server returns **`ParameterError`** with no signal that the type was guessed.

When the parser cannot determine a concrete type, it **must** raise a **parse-time** error with a clear message, e.g.:

```
Cannot determine type of bin 'a'. Add an explicit type suffix on the path:
  $.a:INT     for integer
  $.a:STRING  for string
  $.a:FLOAT   for float
```

Parse-time failure is preferred over opaque runtime errors.

### 1. Inference from literals

When a bin or variable appears in an expression with a literal, the literal's type
propagates to the unknown side.

| Expression | Inferred types | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `$.a == 'hello'` | `a` → STRING | String literal on one side of `==` |
| `$.a > 10` | `a` → INTEGER | Integer literal on one side of comparison |
| `$.a + 3.14` | `a` → FLOAT | Float literal in arithmetic |
| `$.a == true` | `a` → BOOLEAN | Boolean literal on one side of `==` |
| `$.a + 1` | `a` → INTEGER | Integer literal in additive expression |
| `$.a * 2.5` | `a` → FLOAT | Float literal in multiplicative expression |

### 2. Inference from operators

Each operator constrains its operands and/or produces a known result type.

**Logical operators (`and`, `or`):**
Both operands must be BOOLEAN; result is BOOLEAN.
```
$.a and $.b          →  a: BOOLEAN, b: BOOLEAN
$.a or true          →  a: BOOLEAN
```

**Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`):**
Both operands must be the same type; result is BOOLEAN.
If one side has a known type and the other is UNKNOWN, the UNKNOWN side inherits.
```
$.a == $.b           →  if either has a known type, the other gets it
$.a > 10             →  a: INTEGER (from literal); result: BOOLEAN
$.a != 'hello'       →  a: STRING; result: BOOLEAN
```

**Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`):**
Both operands must be numeric (INTEGER or FLOAT) and the same type.
All operands in a chain are unified to the same numeric type.
```
$.a + $.b + $.c + 1  →  a, b, c: INTEGER (from literal 1)
$.a * $.b + 2.0      →  a, b: FLOAT (from literal 2.0)
$.a + $.b            →  both must be numeric; if one is known, the other inherits
```

**Exponent (`**`):**
Both operands must be FLOAT; result is FLOAT.
```
$.a ** $.b           →  a: FLOAT, b: FLOAT
$.a ** 2             →  ERROR: 2 is INTEGER but ** requires FLOAT; use 2.0
```

**Shift operators (`<<`, `>>`, `>>>`):**
Both operands must be INTEGER; result is INTEGER.
```
$.a << 2             →  a: INTEGER
$.a >> $.b           →  a: INTEGER, b: INTEGER
```

**Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`):**
Both operands must be INTEGER; result is INTEGER.
```
$.a & 0xFF           →  a: INTEGER
$.a | $.b            →  a: INTEGER, b: INTEGER
```

**Unary operators:**
- `not(expr)` — operand must be BOOLEAN; result is BOOLEAN
- `~expr` — operand must be INTEGER; result is INTEGER
- `+expr`, `-expr` — operand must be numeric; result keeps operand type

```
not($.a)             →  a: BOOLEAN
~$.a                 →  a: INTEGER
-$.a                 →  a: numeric (INTEGER or FLOAT, preserved)
```

### 3. Inference from functions

Each function constrains its parameters and produces a known return type.

| Function | Parameter types | Return type | Inference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `abs(x)` | numeric | same as `x` | If `x` is UNKNOWN, stays numeric |
| `ceil(x)` | FLOAT | FLOAT | `x` → FLOAT |
| `floor(x)` | FLOAT | FLOAT | `x` → FLOAT |
| `log(x, base)` | FLOAT, FLOAT | FLOAT | `x` → FLOAT, `base` → FLOAT |
| `min(a, b, …)` | numeric, all same | same as args | All unified to same type |
| `max(a, b, …)` | numeric, all same | same as args | All unified to same type |
| `count(x)` | INTEGER | INTEGER | `x` → INTEGER |
| `exclusive(a, b, …)` | BOOLEAN, all | BOOLEAN | All args → BOOLEAN |
| `lscan(x, bool)` | INTEGER, BOOLEAN | INTEGER | `x` → INTEGER, `bool` → BOOLEAN |
| `rscan(x, bool)` | INTEGER, BOOLEAN | INTEGER | `x` → INTEGER, `bool` → BOOLEAN |
| `int(x)` | FLOAT | INTEGER | `x` → FLOAT (cast) |
| `float(x)` | INTEGER | FLOAT | `x` → INTEGER (cast) |
| `geo(x)` | STRING | GEO | `x` → STRING (cast) |
| `contains(a, b)` | GEO, GEO | BOOLEAN | `a` → GEO, `b` → GEO |

**Regex:**
```
$.name =~ /pattern/i    →  name: STRING; result: BOOLEAN
```
The left operand of `=~` must be STRING; result is always BOOLEAN.

### 4. Inference from `when` expressions

Condition expressions (left of `=>`) must all be BOOLEAN. All action expressions (the right side of `=>`) must be the same type. The `when`
expression's type is that unified action type. The exception is the `unknown` or `error` condition which can be mixed with any other types 
as it throws an exception.

```
when (
    $.b == 1 => $.a1,
    $.b == 2 => $.a2,
    $.b == 3 => $.a3,
    default  => 'hello'
)
```
Inference chain:
- `$.b == 1` → `b`: INTEGER (from literal `1`); condition is BOOLEAN ✓
- `default => 'hello'` → action type is STRING (from literal `'hello'`)
- All actions must be the same type → `a1`, `a2`, `a3`: STRING
- The `when` expression's type is STRING

So if this `when` appears in `$.a == when(...)`, then `a` is also STRING.

### 5. Inference from `let … then` expressions

Variable definitions in a `let` block inherit their type from the assigned expression.
The `then` expression can use these variables and their known types propagate.

```
let (x = $.a + 1, y = ${x} * 2) then (${y} > 10)
```
Inference chain:
- `$.a + 1` → `a`: INTEGER → `x`: INTEGER
- `${x} * 2` → already INTEGER → `y`: INTEGER
- `${y} > 10` → confirmed INTEGER; result: BOOLEAN

### 6. Inference from record metadata functions

| Function | Return type |
|---|---|
| `$.ttl()`, `$.voidTime()`, `$.lastUpdateTime()`, `$.timeSinceLastUpdate()` | INTEGER |
| `$.deviceSize()`, `$.memorySize()`, `$.recordSize()` | INTEGER |
| `$.keyExists()`, `$.isTombstone()` | BOOLEAN |
| `$.setName()` | STRING |
| `$.key()` with optional **`:⟨type⟩`** | The named return type when the suffix is present (**`$.key():INT`**, **`$.key():STRING`**, …); otherwise inferred from context (e.g. **`$.key() == 'Bob'`** → STRING) |
| `$.type()` | INTEGER |
| `$.exists()` | BOOLEAN |

**`$.key()`:** The record primary key / digest is read with **`$.key()`**. An optional **`:⟨type⟩`** suffix **after** **`()`** — where **⟨type⟩** stands for a **concrete** AEL type name such as **`INT`**, **`STRING`**, or **`BLOB`** (not the letters “T”) — sets the static type. Omit the suffix when the surrounding expression already fixes the type — for example **`$.key() == 'Bob'`** constrains the key to **STRING** without writing **`$.key():STRING`**.

### 7. Inference from list/map path shape

Using **list** or **map** selectors on a bin constrains that bin’s CDT type:

```
$.a.[0]:INT       →  a: LIST (list index selector on `a`)
$.a.x:INT         →  a: MAP (map key segment `x` on `a`)
$.a.count()       →  a: LIST or MAP (ambiguous until another constraint resolves it)
$.a.sort().[0]:INT →  a: LIST (`sort` applies only to list bins)
```

A **`:⟨type⟩`** suffix on the **path tail** (after the selector that names the value) sets the static type of the read, in the same family as on a bin root such as **`$.score:INT`** ([DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), [path-and-selectors.md](path-and-selectors.md)).

### 8. Cross-expression propagation (deferred validation)

Types may not be known when first encountered. The parser must defer validation
and re-check after the full expression is parsed.

```
$.b == $.d or $.c > $.b
```
- First pass: `$.b == $.d` → both UNKNOWN, defer SAME_TYPE validation
- Continue: `$.c > $.b` → both UNKNOWN, no inference yet
- If later `$.c` gets a type (e.g., from `$.c + 1` elsewhere), `c` → INTEGER
- Re-apply deferred: `$.c > $.b` → `b`: INTEGER (from `c`)
- Re-apply deferred: `$.b == $.d` → `d`: INTEGER (from `b`)

More complex example:
```
$.a == when($.b == 1 => $.a1, $.b == 2 => $.a2, default => 'hello')
    and $.c
    and $.a + 1 == $.d
```
Inference chain:
1. `$.b == 1` → `b`: INTEGER
2. `default => 'hello'` → action type STRING → `a1`, `a2`: STRING
3. `when(...)` result: STRING → `$.a == when(...)` → `a`: STRING
4. `($.a == when(...)) and ...` → the `==` comparison returns BOOLEAN, which is valid
   for `and`. But `and $.c` → `c`: BOOLEAN
5. `$.a + 1` requires `a` to be INTEGER (from literal `1`), but step 3 set `a` to STRING
6. **ERROR**: Bin `a` used as both STRING (from `==` with `when`) and INTEGER (from `+ 1`)

Note that if we changed the example slightly so `a` was not reused:

```
when($.b == 1 => $.a1, $.b == 2 => $.a2, default => 'hello')
    and $.c
```

Here the `when(...)` result is STRING, and `and` requires both operands to be BOOLEAN.
A STRING is not BOOLEAN, so this is also an **ERROR**: `when` result type STRING is
incompatible with `and` which requires BOOLEAN operands.

Correct version:
```
$.a == when($.b == 1 => $.a1, $.b == 2 => $.a2, default => 5)
    and $.c
    and $.a + 1 == $.d
```
1. `$.b == 1` → `b`: INTEGER
2. `default => 5` → action type INTEGER → `a1`, `a2`: INTEGER
3. `when(...)` result: INTEGER → `$.a == when(...)` → `a`: INTEGER
4. `$.a == when(...)` returns BOOLEAN → valid operand for `and` ✓
5. `and $.c` → `c`: BOOLEAN (required by `and`)
6. `$.a + 1` → `a` already INTEGER ✓ → result INTEGER
7. `($.a + 1) == $.d` → `d`: INTEGER

### 9. Path expression inference

Within `*[?(...)]` filters and `.modify()` expressions, `@` (loop variable) follows
the same inference rules as bins:

```
*[?(@.price > 10.0)]        →  @.price: FLOAT
*[?(@key == 'revenue')]      →  @key: STRING (always STRING for map keys)
*[?(@index < 3)]             →  @index: INTEGER (always INTEGER for list indices)
*.price.modify(@ * 0.9)      →  @: FLOAT (from literal 0.9)
*[?(@ > $.threshold:INT)]  →  @: INTEGER (from explicit type on other side)
```

### 10. Inference from sub-expressions in path parameters

When a sub-expression `(expr)` appears inside a path element, the structural position
constrains the expression's type (input), and surrounding context constrains the
path element's return type (output). Both directions propagate simultaneously.

**Input constraints from position:**
```
$.m.{($.idx)}            →  idx: INTEGER (map-by-index requires INTEGER)
$.m.{#($.r)}             →  r: INTEGER (map-by-rank requires INTEGER)
$.m.($.key)              →  key: STRING, INTEGER, or BLOB (valid map key types)
$.l.[($.i)]              →  i: INTEGER (list-by-index requires INTEGER)
$.m.{($.lo):($.hi)}      →  lo: INTEGER, hi: INTEGER (index range bounds)
$.m.{($.s)-($.e)}        →  s and e: SAME_TYPE, must be STRING, INTEGER, or BLOB
```

**Output constraints from context:**
```
$.m.{($.idx)} == 'hello' →  idx: INTEGER (from position), output: STRING (from literal)
$.m.{($.idx)} > 10       →  idx: INTEGER (from position), output: INTEGER (from literal)
$.m.($.key) + 1           →  key: STRING/INTEGER/BLOB (from position), output: INTEGER (from + 1)
$.l.[($.i)] == true       →  i: INTEGER (from position), output: BOOLEAN (from literal)
```

**Bidirectional inference in a single expression:**
```
$.m.{($.idx)} == $.other
```
- `$.idx` → INTEGER (from the `{...}` index position)
- `$.m.{($.idx)}` output and `$.other` → SAME_TYPE (from `==`)
- If `$.other` is resolved elsewhere (e.g., `$.other > 3.14`), then both the output
  and `$.other` become FLOAT

**List-vs-singular disambiguation feeds back into inference:**
```
$.m.{($.x)}.count()
```
- `.count()` only applies to collections → the result of `{($.x)}` must be a
  collection → `$.x` must be LIST (key list form, not index form)

### 11. Explicit type annotations

When inference is not possible (e.g., both sides of a comparison are bins with no
literal context), the user can provide explicit type annotations using a **`:`** followed by a **concrete** type name (**`INT`**, **`STRING`**, **`FLOAT`**, …) on a path — for example **`$.a:INT`**, **`$.m.{($.idx)}:INT`**, **`$.l.[0]:INT`**, **`$.m.k:STRING`** — or on the loop variable (**`@:INT`**, **`@.field:FLOAT`**), or **after** no-arg record helpers (**`$.key():INT`**, …) when a declared type is required, or cast functions like `.asInt()` and `.asFloat()`.

```
$.a:INT == $.b       a explicitly typed as INTEGER; b inherits INTEGER
$.a:FLOAT > $.b     a explicitly typed as FLOAT; b inherits FLOAT
$.a.asInt() + $.b               a cast to INTEGER; b inherits INTEGER
```

Note that only one side needs the explicit annotation — the other side is inferred
via the same-type rule on the comparison or arithmetic operator. Annotating both
sides is valid but redundant:
```
$.a:FLOAT > $.b:FLOAT   valid but only one side needed
```

Typed reads at a list index or map key use **selectors** with an optional **`:⟨type⟩`** suffix on the segment that yields the scalar (or collection) value:

```
$.myList.[0]:INT
$.myMap.x:STRING
```

That suffix (always a **concrete** type name in source, never a standalone placeholder token) is the AEL surface for static typing here; the compiler maps to the appropriate **`MapExp` / `ListExp`** **`getBy*`** + type wiring ([DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)).

### 12. Error conditions

The parser must raise an error when:

| Condition | Example | Error |
|---|---|---|
| Conflicting types for same bin | `$.a > 1 and $.a == 'hello'` | `a` is both INTEGER and STRING |
| Conflicting types for same variable | `let (x = 1) then (${x} == 'hi')` | `x` is INTEGER but compared to STRING |
| Unresolved UNKNOWN | `$.a == $.b` (no other context) | Neither `a` nor `b` can be typed; suggest a concrete suffix such as **`$.a:INT`** / **`$.b:INT`** or **`@:INT`** in filters ([DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)) |
| Unresolved SAME_TYPE | `$.a == $.b` where neither resolves | Both linked but no concrete type discovered |
| Unresolved NUMERIC | `$.a + $.b` (no literals in scope) | Known to be numeric but INTEGER vs FLOAT not determined |
| Wrong type for operator | `$.a and 5` | `and` requires BOOLEAN, got INTEGER |
| Mixed numeric types without cast | `$.a + $.b` where `a` is INT, `b` is FLOAT | Use `float($.a) + $.b` or `$.a + int($.b)` |
| Non-numeric in arithmetic | `$.a + 'hello'` | `+` requires numeric |
| Non-boolean in logical | `'hello' or true` | `or` requires BOOLEAN |
| Non-string in regex | `5 =~ /pat/` | `=~` requires STRING on left |
| Non-integer in bitwise | `3.14 & 0xFF` | `&` requires INTEGER |
| Exponent with integer | `$.a ** 2` | `**` requires FLOAT; use `2.0` |

### 13. Possible implementation strategy

1. **First pass (during parse):** Apply type inference rules as expressions are parsed.
   Assign intermediate states (`UNKNOWN`, `SAME_TYPE`, `NUMERIC`) where concrete types
   cannot yet be determined. Propagate concrete types immediately when available.
2. **Deferred validations:** When both sides of an operator are in intermediate states,
   record the constraint (e.g., "these two must be SAME_TYPE", "these two must be NUMERIC").
   Avoid guessing or assigning a default.
3. **Second pass (post-parse):** Re-apply all deferred validations. Types discovered
   later in the parse can now resolve intermediate states recorded earlier.
4. **Final validation:** Check that every bin, variable, and sub-expression has resolved
   to a concrete type. If any remain in an intermediate state (`UNKNOWN`, `SAME_TYPE`,
   or `NUMERIC`), raise a parse error listing the unresolved items with a suggestion
   to add explicit type annotations. **Avoid falling back to a default type.**
5. **CDT function resolution:** After type inference, resolve generic CDT functions
   (e.g., `size()`) to list-specific or map-specific variants based on the inferred
   bin type.
